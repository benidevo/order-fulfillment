# Product Requirements Document: Order Fulfillment Service

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

In e-commerce systems, order fulfillment requires accurate inventory tracking, efficient order processing, and reliable status updates. Traditional monolithic approaches often struggle with complexity, scalability, and maintaining historical context of operations. This project demonstrates how Event Sourcing and CQRS architectural patterns can address these challenges while providing a more maintainable and extensible architecture.

### Project Goal

Create an educational order fulfillment service that demonstrates Event Sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) patterns using Java and Node.js with Kafka as an event bus. This service will showcase how these patterns facilitate domain separation, event-driven architecture, and the benefits of separate read and write models.

### Educational Focus

This project is intentionally designed as a learning tool rather than a production system. It prioritizes clarity of architectural concepts over enterprise-grade features, using in-memory storage for simplicity while maintaining proper event publishing to demonstrate eventual consistency.

### Scope

The project will include:

- Order registration (receiving finalized orders from upstream)
- Inventory allocation and verification
- Order status tracking through the fulfillment lifecycle
- Order cancellation with inventory returns
- Separation of command and query responsibilities
- Event-driven communication between components
- Demonstration of event sourcing as the source of truth

### Out of Scope

- Persistent storage beyond Kafka (using in-memory for simplicity)
- Authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
- Production-grade performance optimizations
- UI components
- Complex business workflows beyond basic fulfillment

## System Architecture

The system follows a clean CQRS architecture with the following components:

### Command Side (Java)

- RESTful API for receiving commands (register order, update status, cancel)
- Command handlers for validation and processing
- Domain models with proper aggregate boundaries
- Event generation and publishing to Kafka
- In-memory event store for simplicity

### Event Bus (Kafka)

- Central event distribution mechanism
- Maintains ordered event streams
- Enables eventual consistency between command and query sides
- Provides event replay capabilities

### Query Side (Node.js - Planned)

- Event consumers creating read-optimized projections
- In-memory projection storage (MongoDB planned for future)
- RESTful API for efficient queries
- Multiple specialized read models based on use cases

## Domain Models

### Order Aggregate

- Core entity representing customer orders
- Maintains items, addresses, and status
- Enforces business rules for status transitions
- Generates events for state changes

### Inventory Aggregate

- Manages product availability
- Handles allocation and returns
- Enforces inventory constraints
- Maintains separation from Order aggregate

## Core Events

### Order Events

- OrderCreated - When a new order is registered
- OrderStatusUpdated - When an order transitions states
- OrderCancelled - When an order is cancelled

### Inventory Events

- InventoryUpdated - When stock levels change
- InventoryAllocated - When inventory is reserved for an order
- InventoryReturned - When inventory is returned from cancelled orders

## Query Models (Planned)

- OrderSummary - Current state of all orders
- InventoryStatus - Current inventory levels
- ShippingManifest - Orders ready to be shipped
- FulfillmentDashboard - Operational metrics

## Technical Stack

- **Command Side**: Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Kafka
- **Event Bus**: Apache Kafka
- **Query Side (Planned)**: Node.js, Express, KafkaJS
- **Storage**: In-memory with Kafka as event log
- **Containers**: Docker and Docker Compose

## Implementation Approach

1. Start with a clean domain model following DDD principles
2. Implement the command side with proper aggregate boundaries
3. Set up Kafka as the event distribution mechanism
4. Create the query side with read-optimized models
5. Demonstrate eventual consistency between sides

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. It clearly demonstrates CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns
2. Commands properly update the system state and generate events
3. The query side builds projections from events
4. The system handles the basic order fulfillment workflow
5. Events can be replayed to rebuild system state
6. Documentation clearly explains the architectural concepts
