# Product Requirements Document: Order Fulfillment Service

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

In e-commerce systems, order fulfillment requires accurate inventory tracking, efficient order processing, and reliable status updates. Traditional systems often struggle with transaction consistency, audit capabilities, and maintaining the historical context of fulfillment operations. Implementing a service using Event Sourcing and CQRS patterns can address these limitations while providing a more scalable and maintainable architecture.

### Project Goal

Develop a focused order fulfillment service that demonstrates the practical implementation of Event Sourcing and CQRS patterns using Java, Node.js, and Kafka. The system will receive finalized orders from upstream services, manage inventory allocation, and track the fulfillment lifecycle with a complete event history.

### Scope

This project is intentionally limited in scope to be completable within a weekend while still demonstrating the core architectural patterns. It includes:

- Order registration (receiving finalized orders from upstream)
- Inventory allocation and verification
- Order status tracking through fulfillment process
- Order cancellation processing
- Inventory management

### Out of Scope

- Order creation and payment processing (handled by upstream services)
- Product catalog management (handled by a catalog service)
- Customer management (handled by a customer service)
- Refund processing for partially fulfilled orders
- User authentication and authorization
- Shipping provider integration
- UI features

## System Context

The Order Fulfillment Service operates within a larger e-commerce ecosystem:

1. **Upstream Services**: Submit finalized, paid orders to our service
2. **Product/Inventory Service**: Publishes events about product creation and inventory updates
3. **Fulfillment Service (this system)**: Processes orders through the fulfillment lifecycle
4. **Downstream Consumers**: May subscribe to fulfillment events (shipping partners, notification services)

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Order Registration

- Receive finalized orders from upstream services
- Validate order structure and required fields
- Check inventory availability for ordered items
- Register orders for fulfillment or reject with clear reason

### 2. Inventory Management

- Maintain a projection of current inventory levels from Product Service events
- Allocate inventory to orders when registered
- Return inventory to available stock when orders are canceled
- Provide current inventory status for operational decisions

### 3. Order Fulfillment Process

- Track order status transitions (Registered → Confirmed → Shipped → Delivered)
- Support full order fulfillment when inventory is available
- For orders with insufficient inventory, close the order (refund handled elsewhere)
- Record timestamps for all status changes

### 4. Order Cancellation

- Process cancellation requests for orders not yet shipped
- Return allocated inventory to available stock
- Record cancellation events with reasons

### 5. Querying Capabilities

- View order fulfillment details by ID
- List orders by status
- Track inventory levels and allocation history
- View fulfillment statistics and metrics

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Architecture

The system will follow an Event Sourcing and CQRS architecture with the following components:

#### Command Side (Java)

- RESTful API for receiving commands (register order, update status, cancel)
- Command handlers for validating and processing commands
- Event generators for creating domain events
- Kafka producer for publishing events to the event store

#### Event Store (Kafka)

- Dedicated topics for different event types
- Persistent storage of all events with appropriate retention

#### Query Side (Node.js)

- Event consumers for updating read models
- RESTful API for querying read models
- Multiple read models optimized for different query patterns

### 2. Event Types

The system will use the following core event types:

- Inventory Events:
  - InventoryUpdated (received from Product Service)
  - InventoryAllocated
  - InventoryReturned

- Order Events:
  - OrderReceived
  - OrderRegistered
  - OrderRejected
  - OrderConfirmed
  - OrderShipped
  - OrderDelivered
  - OrderCancelled

### 3. Read Models

The system will maintain the following read models:

- Inventory Status: Current inventory levels for all products
- Order Status: Current status of all orders in the system
- Fulfillment Dashboard: Aggregated metrics on fulfillment operations
- Shipping Manifest: Orders ready to be shipped

### 4. Technologies

- Command Side:
  - Java 17+
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring Kafka
  - RESTful API with Spring Web

- Event Store:
  - Apache Kafka
  - Kafka Streams (for event processing)

- Query Side:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - KafkaJS (for consuming events)
  - MongoDB (for read models)

- Development & Testing:
  - Docker and Docker Compose (for local environment)
  - JUnit and Jest (for testing)
  - Postman (for API testing)

## Event Schema Design

All events should follow a consistent schema:

```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "eventType": "string",
  "aggregateId": "string",
  "aggregateType": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 datetime",
  "version": "number",
  "payload": {
    // Event-specific data
  },
  "metadata": {
    "userId": "string",
    "correlationId": "string",
    // Additional contextual information
  }
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Unit Testing

- Test command validation logic
- Test event generation from commands
- Test read model projections from events

### 2. Integration Testing

- Test command API endpoints
- Test query API endpoints
- Test event flow from commands to read models

### 3. Test Scenarios

- Register a new order and verify it appears in query models
- Test inventory allocation and verification logic
- Cancel an order and verify inventory is returned
- Register an order with insufficient inventory and verify rejection
- Verify status transitions work correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

The project will be considered complete when:

1. The service can receive and register orders from upstream systems
2. Inventory is properly checked and allocated during order registration
3. Orders can be processed through the fulfillment workflow
4. Cancellations are properly processed with inventory returns
5. Read models accurately reflect the current state of orders and inventory
6. The system demonstrates:
   - Event sourcing (all state changes are stored as events)
   - CQRS (separate command and query models)
   - Eventual consistency (read models are updated asynchronously)

## Conclusion

This focused order fulfillment service demonstrates Event Sourcing and CQRS patterns while remaining scoped appropriately for a weekend project.
